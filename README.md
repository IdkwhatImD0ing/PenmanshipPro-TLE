## Elevator pitch

Our program is designed to help people improve their handwriting skills and increase legibility. With Penmanship Pro, you'll be able to write confidently, clearly, and concisely. 

## Inspiration: 
In today’s digital world, most people are suffering from handwriting skills; a Survey finds Nearly half of Americans struggle to read their handwriting. So we decided to help people better their handwriting skills, and with Penmanship pro, we do just that. It will allow you to sharpen up your handwriting skill. 

## What it does
Our website is a helpful resource for anyone looking to improve their handwriting, whether for personal or professional reasons. These resources may include worksheets, exercises, and lessons on proper handwriting techniques, as well as tips and tricks for creating legible and attractive handwriting. We use a well-trained machine-learning model to give users the best feedback on their practice.

## How we built it
We built penmanship pro using React for the front end and python flask socketio for the backend. To provide the feedback to users, a train machine learning model was added to the backend, so when the handwriting test is passed to the backend as a 2d array, the data goes through the model to get a score


## Challenges we ran into
Given the fact that we are still beginners. We’ve encountered various challenges, such as implementing the flask and the backend part. It was also difficult for us to deploy the Machine learning model for the first time and send images over socketio

## Accomplishments that we're proud of

Our team was able to create a fully functional web app within 24hr hours.  

## What we learned
We learned about various technologies/ frameworks and  cloud services such as flask, replit, Microsoft cloud. 

## What's next for Untitled
Creating a mobile app would be our next move.
