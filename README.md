## Elevator pitch

Our program is designed to help people improve their handwriting skills and increase legibility. With Penmanship Pro, you'll be able to write confidently, clearly, and concisely. 

## Inspiration: 
In today's modern age, it's not uncommon for people to struggle with their handwriting skills. According to a recent survey, almost half of Americans have difficulty reading their own handwriting. That's why we developed Penmanship Pro - a tool designed to help improve handwriting skills. With its guidance and practice exercises, Penmanship Pro will allow you to refine your handwriting and boost your skills to a whole new level.

## What it does
Our website is a comprehensive resource for individuals seeking to improve their handwriting. Our resources include a variety of worksheets, exercises, and lessons on proper handwriting techniques that will help you develop legible and aesthetically pleasing handwriting. Additionally, we offer tips and tricks that will aid you in your handwriting journey. To ensure that our users receive the most accurate and helpful feedback, we have implemented a well-trained machine-learning model that evaluates practice exercises. Whether you want to improve your handwriting for personal or professional reasons, our website has everything you need to succeed.

## How we built it
Penmanship Pro was developed using React for the front-end interface and Python Flask for the back-end. Socket.io was implemented to facilitate communication between the front-end and back-end. In order to provide users with detailed and accurate feedback on their handwriting, we have utilized a custom-trained machine learning model. This model evaluates users' writing and assigns a score based on various factors such as legibility, consistency, and overall appearance. In this way, Penmanship Pro is able to offer personalized guidance and support to help users improve their handwriting skills.


## Challenges we ran into
One of the main challenges we faced was implementing the Flask back-end and integrating it with the front-end interface built with React. Additionally, deploying the machine learning model for the first time and implementing Socket.io to send images presented a significant challenge. Despite these difficulties, we have persevered and are proud to have overcome these obstacles and successfully launched Penmanship Pro.
